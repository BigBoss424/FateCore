Things that need to be done:
1) Create the Objects for the program
	This includes but isn't limited to:
		1) Character
		2) Player
2) Create the utilities for the program
	This includes but isn't limited to:
		1) FileUtil
		2) ValidationCheckUtil
3) Finish the driver class FateCoreCharacterCreation
================================================================================

1) Create the Objects for the program 
	1) Character.java
		a) Getters and Setters
		b) DVC and EVC
		c) equalsTo and compareTo
		d) toString
	2) Player (not sure if I'll implement this or not)
	3) RandomPlayer (This will be delved into later)
2) Create the utilities for the program
	1) FileUtil
		a) readFile
		b) writeFile
		c) deleteFile
		d) editFile
		(will create more methods if needed)
	2) ValidationCheckUtil
		This one is going to be tricky to develop but the focus should be in validating the users input into the program to make sure it doesn't break the program.
